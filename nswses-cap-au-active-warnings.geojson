The Feed must be used in accordance with the terms set out below or otherwise notified to the public via any URL used by the State of NSW or to you specifically from time to time (Terms). Use of the Feed is deemed to be acceptance of the then current Terms.\n\n  The Feed enables receipt and distribution of warnings data to help people make informed decisions based on those warnings. For the purposes of these Terms, a reference to a warning means all warning information published on the Feed, including location and hazard information, a warning statement, warning level and the Australian Warning System hazard icons. The warnings are NOT 'real-time'. In using the Feed to develop applications or services (including those provided via social media accounts), you must review and follow the Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience Guideline for Warnings Republishers (the Guideline) available at https://www.aidr.org.au/.  Without limiting those obligations, if: 1) the Terms permit you to republish data in the Feed; or 2) the Feed is provided to you initially only for internal research and testing but the State of NSW has later given written approval to you to republish data in the Feed, the following applies to your republication of any warnings -  You must: a) not amend or alter the warnings. ; b) not add any information which would make a warning inaccurate or misleading; and c) acknowledge the relevant emergency services agency issuing the warning e.g. NSW SES.\n\n  Although care is taken to ensure reasonable currency and accuracy of the Feed, the State of NSW: 1) does not guarantee that the Feed will always be available, continuous, up to date, complete or error-free and recommends that users of the Feed should exercise their own skill and care in doing so, not rely solely on the Feed, and consider a range of information sources in making their decisions; and 2) disclaims any liability in contract, tort (including negligence) or on any other legal basis, for any loss, damage, cost or expense asserted to be suffered as a result of use of or reliance by any person on the Feed.\n    \n  Using the Feed, you:  \n\n  1) acknowledge the limitations of the Feed outlined in the Terms; \n\n  2) must, in any application or service utilising the Feed, attribute NSW SES, FRNSW or such other emergency services agencies, including non-NSW state or territory government agencies in this form: For example: 'Â© State of New South Wales (NSW State Emergency Service) in respect of the relevant dataset, unless you have an agreement or arrangement providing for an alternative attribution of the Feed;  \n\n  3) must observe and retain any copyright or related notices accompanying the Feed as part of the attribution; and \n\n  4) acknowledge and must comply with the following additional obligations if the State of NSW notifies you that the Feed is provided to you for internal research and testing (the Permitted Use): a) you may only use the Feed for the Permitted Use and not republish data in the Feed publicly; b) you must not publicly refer to any matters relating to the Permitted Use; and c) you may do a thing not permitted by a) or b) only if the State of NSW has given you prior express written approval to do so, which approval may be granted in the absolute discretion of the State of NSW and subject to any conditions which it thinks appropriate e.g. a review and approval by the State of NSW of the proposed republication method. \n\n  The State of NSW may in its absolute discretion terminate your right to use the Feed for any reason whatsoever (including for breach of any of the Terms or use which may damage the reputation of the State of NSW or any other improper use).\n",
